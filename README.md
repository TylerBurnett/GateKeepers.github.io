# GateKeepers.github.io
A website design made with only HTML5 and CSS. (And font awesome for icons!)

## This isnt real
Gate Keepers is a ficticious company I was tasked to create in my web design course 1621ICT as a part of my undergraduate degree.
The final grade awarded to this website was 100% marks, marked on code structure, design, and CSS cleanlyness. 
There was also a final criteria that allowed marks for additional content above and beyod the requirements of the course.
With that criteria in mind, I would have scored 103% of the marks, sadly 100% is the limit so I was sadly left with full marks.
